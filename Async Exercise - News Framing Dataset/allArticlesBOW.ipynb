    "# Hands-on: Text Processing\n",
    "This hands-on will cover the necessary steps in a text processing pipeline for Human Language Technologies (HLT). Some examples of projects and tasks in which this pipeline will be useful are the following:\n",
    "- **Language Translation** - translation of a sentence or body of text from one language to another\n",
    "- **Word Sense Disambiguation** - determining the meaning and context of a polysemic word in a body of text\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis** - determining the overall sentiment towards a certain topic or word, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral\n",
    "- **Topic Modeling** - identifying the different topics discusses in a text and determining the most prevalent one\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are others more like question answering, information extraction, and more recently, detecting mis/disinformation."

       "  'article_body': 'New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker directed health officials to prioritize the governor\\'s own family and figures with ties to his administration in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report Wednesday.\\n\\nFamily members who allegedly received preferential testing included Cuomo\\'s brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, as well as his mother and at least one of his sisters, the Albany Times-Union reported, citing sources with direct knowledge of the matter.\\n\\nSome family members reportedly received multiple tests. Chris Cuomo was reportedly tested at his home on Long Island. One source told the Times-Union that tests administered to Cuomo’s family members or associates were referred to as \"critical samples\" and processed ahead of others.\\n\\nCUOMO ACCUSER SLAMS NY GOV\\'S CLAIM HE MUST FOLLOW \\'RULES\\' AND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM\\n\\nWell-known figures who received tests in the early days of the pandemic included Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and his wife; and Patrick Foye, head of New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authorities, and his wife. Some unnamed media members and state legislators were also tested.\\n\\nCuomo administration officials denied that anyone received preferential treatment. Richard Azzopardi, a top adviser to Cuomo, said the allegations were \"insincere efforts to rewrite the past.\"\\n\\n\"In the early days of this pandemic, when there was a heavy emphasis on contact tracing, we were absolutely going above and beyond to get people testing — including in some instances going to people’s homes, and door-to-door in places like New Rochelle — to take samples from those believed to have been exposed to COVID in order to identify cases and prevent additional ones,\" Azzopardi said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Among those we assisted were members of the general public, including legislators, reporters, state workers and their families who feared they had contracted the virus and had the capability to further spread it,\" he added.\\n\\nThe New York State Department of Health denied requests for comment from Zucker and Eleanor Adams, an epidemiologist who reportedly tested Cuomo\\'s brother.\\n\\n\"You’re asking professionals who took an oath to protect a patient’s privacy to violate that oath and compromise their integrity,\" said Gary Holmes, a spokesman for the department of health. \"More than 43 million New Yorkers have been tested, and commenting on any of them would be a serious violation of medical ethics. We’ve built a nation-leading testing infrastructure to ensure that anybody who needs a test could get one. That work continues today.\"\\n\\nThe bombshell report emerged as Cuomo faces calls to resign after eight women, including current and former aides, accused him of sexual harassment or misconduct. The New York State Attorney General’s Office and the State Assembly are investigating the claims.\\n\\nSeparately, federal authorities opened a probe into members of the Cuomo administration over their handling of New York’s COVID-19 nursing home crisis. The governor’s office has denied claims that it significantly underreported or covered up the number of COVID-19 deaths that occurred at nursing home facilities.',\n",

       "  'article_body': 'AstraZeneca on Thursday published an updated analysis confirming that a Phase 3 trial involving its COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective, and showed to be 76% effective against symptomatic COVID-19. The update came after the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said the company may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data after the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) said it was concerned about the information included in the release.\\n\\n\"The DSMB expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,\" the NIAID said in a statement earlier this week. \"We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible.\"\\n\\nThe earlier data reflected 79% efficacy in preventing symptomatic infections and 100% efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalization. The new analysis also reported 100% efficacy \"against severe or critical disease and hospitalization.\"\\n\\nUS TOPS 30M CORONAVIRUS INFECTIONS, JHU DATA SHOWS\\n\\n\"Positive high-level results from the primary analysis of the Phase III trial of AZD1222 in the U.S. have confirmed vaccine efficacy consistent with the pre-specified interim analysis announced on Monday 22 March 2021,\" a press release posted by AstraZeneca early Thursday stated. \"These results have been presented to the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. The primary analysis is pre-specificed in the protocol and will be the basis for a regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, when asked if the back-and-forth regarding data reporting may add to vaccine hesitancy in the U.S., Dr. Anthony Fauci lauded the FDA’s transparent approval process in helping to build the public’s confidence should the jab see approval.\\n\\nTRANSPARENCY IN ASTRAZENECA APPROVAL PROCESS \\'HOPEFULLY\\' WILL DISPEL HESITANCY, FAUCI SAYS\\n\\n\"We’re always concerned when there is an apparent ‘miscommunication’ – if you want to use that word – that it would add to already existing levels of vaccine hesitancy, which is the reason why we want to make sure we’re always completely transparent in everything that goes with regard to messaging and vaccine,\" Fauci said during Wednesday’s White House COVID-19 briefing.\\n\\nHe said that the process will \"hopefully dispel any hesitancy associated with this little bump in the road we happened to have most recently with AstraZeneca.\" Questions over how the public would perceive AstraZeneca’s vaccine were already swirling after reports of blood clots in Europe saw several countries temporarily pause the rollout. European regulators have since found the vaccine to be safe and effective and the rollout has continued.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\\n\\n\"At the end of the day, when you look at the data, this is going to turn out to be a good vaccine,\" Fauci said.',\n",

       "  'article_body': 'It’s funny how no one really covers the big stories. Instead the news media bring us minutia, all the time. Cartloads of it.\\n\\nA middle-aged professional golfer hurts his leg in a car accident, and the networks go wall to wall. They literally give his car crash more coverage than they give the bombing of Syria.\\n\\nThen, a few weeks later, some weird, fake duchess from Los Angeles gives a boring interview to Oprah and we stop the presses. It’s all we talk about for days. Meanwhile, something legitimately momentous happens, and it’s crickets.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, for example, two sitting members of the United States Senate announced they oppose the entire foundation of American civil rights law, and then proceed to attack the core principle, the main principle, of our country. Some people on Twitter were shocked by it, but otherwise you’d never really know it happened.\\n\\nDUCKWORTH BACKTRACKS AFTER SAYING SHE\\'S DONE VOTING FOR BIDEN NOMINEES OVER LACK OF AAPI REPRESENTATION\\n\\nBut it did happen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii publicly informed the White House that until the Biden administration puts more people they like in powerful jobs, they will refuse to confirm White nominees.\\n\\n\"I am a no vote on the floor on all non-diversity nominees,\" Duckworth said, out loud, with cameras rolling. \"I will vote for racial minorities and I will vote for LGBTQ, but anybody else, I’m not voting for.\"\\n\\nJust in case you missed it, or were unclear on the meaning, Duckworth said this several times. And then Mazie Hirono backed her up.\\n\\nSEN. MAZIE HIRONO: Tammy’s position is that until she gets a commitment from the White House that there will be more diversity representation in the Cabinet and senior White House advisory positions, she will not vote to confirm anyone who does not represent diversity. So this is not about pitting one diversity group against another. I think this is a well-articulated, focused position, and I am prepared to join her in that.\\n\\nALEX WAGNER, MSNBC: Do you think the Biden administration has been adequately receptive to your entreaties for more diversity?\\n\\nHIRONO: Obviously not, otherwise Tammy and I wouldn’t be taking our position. We would like to encourage them to do better.\\n\\nSo here you have two actual U.S. senators announcing in public they will deny jobs to people who have the wrong skin color. That’s not news? Oh yes, it is news, though Mazie Hirono and Tammy Duckworth may not realize it’s news. In their defense, Hirono and Duckworth are well-known as the dimmest politicians in Washington. Neither one could carry a dinner conversation. But not everyone in Congress is stupid or oblivious.\\n\\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., certainly isn’t. The Senate Majority Leader misses nothing. Chuck Schumer has spent his entire life telling us at high volume that racial discrimination is wrong, which obviously it is. Then, this week, two of his colleagues went on television to demand racial discrimination. What did Chuck Schumer think of that? Schumer didn’t say a word about it. No one in the Democratic Party did.\\n\\nMATT WALSH ACCUSES HIRONO, DUCKWORTH OF \\'ANTI-WHITE RACISM\\'\\n\\nThese are moral pygmies. Some of them would sell their kids if the price was right. Some of them are actually race haters, probably, and they agree with it. But whatever their motives, the fact that his happened in public and no one in power said anything about it seems like a turning point in the history of our country.\\n\\nTo recap the most basic principle we have: All Americans have an inalienable right, given by God and guaranteed by the Constitution, to be judged solely and exclusively on the basis of what they do and of what they choose. Not on the basis of their race, or their genes or who their parents were. That is the entire promise of the country. It’s why we’re different. It’s why people move here from other countries. It’s why we’re a self-governing republic, because everyone is equal.\\n\\nIt’s also, in addition to everything else, federal law. It’s written down. What Mazie Hirono and Tammy Duckworth did is not simply morally repugnant (although it is). It’s also illegal.\\n\\nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act opens this way, \"No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\\n\\nYou cannot deny an American a federal job because of his race. That is against the law, and has been for nearly 60 years.\\n\\nRacial discrimination in government hiring is a crime. You may have heard that before. It’s on the wall of every break room in every office in the United States. In fact, the Civil Rights Act may be the most famous law we have. But then, as now, many prominent Democrats opposed it. Critical race theory is not a new idea, despite what they tell you. In 1964, a third of Senate Democrats voted against the Civil Rights Act. One of those who did was a man called Robert Byrd.\\n\\nByrd was a strident supporter of \"equity\" — or, as it was called at the time, Jim Crow. In 1944, at the height of the Second World War, Robert Byrd wrote a letter to Theodore Bilbo, who represented Mississippi in the Senate. Byrd was upset that the Roosevelt administration was giving federal jobs to people with the wrong skin color. Robert Byrd was the Tammy Duckworth of his day.\\n\\n\"I shall never fight in the armed forces with a Negro by my side,\" Byrd wrote, amazingly. \"Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.\"\\n\\nTUCKER CARLSON VOWS HE WILL \\'NOT BE SILENCED\\' IN FOX NATION VIDEO PODCAST PREVIEW\\n\\nThat’s real. Robert Byrd wrote that. At the time, he was working as a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan, which was very much the Yale University of the time, the source of so much poison in our society. Two years later, Byrd wrote to a well-known critical race theorist called Joel Baskin, who was serving as the grand wizard of their beloved organization.\\n\\n\"The Klan is needed today as never before,\" Byrd wrote, \"and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia. It is necessary that the [Klan] be promoted immediately and in every state in the Union. Will you please inform me as to the possibilities of rebuilding the Klan realm of West Virginia?\"\\n\\nOnce again, that’s real.\\n\\nShortly after he wrote that, Byrd abandoned his Klan career, which never paid well. Instead he decided to run for office as a Democrat. Robert Byrd served in Congress for nearly 60 years. When Byrd died, during Barack Obama’s first term, the entire leadership of the Democratic Party came forward to slobber over his memory — including, amazingly, Barack Obama himself.\\n\\nEX-CNN PRODUCER CALLS FOR NETWORK TO \\'STEP IN\\' AND STOP DON LEMON\\'S \\'DANGEROUS\\' RHETORIC\\n\\n\"It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd,\" said Hillary Clinton. \"He was not just its longest-serving member, he was its heart and soul. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance.\"\\n\\nOf course Hillary Clinton said that.\\n\\n\"While some simply bore witness to history,\" remarked an emotional Nancy Pelosi, \"Senator Byrd shaped it and strove to build a brighter future for us all.\"\\n\\nVice President Joe Biden, always big on memorials, went on perhaps the longest. Biden described Robert Byrd as \"a very close friend of mine, one of my mentors.\" Joe Biden even misquoted William Shakespeare as he celebrated his Klansman mentor.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: AMID PUSH TO REMOVE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS, LITTLE OUTRAGE OVER ROBERT BYRD\\'S NAMESAKES IN HOME STATE\\n\\nBIDEN: When I learned of his death, I was on an errand for the President in Cleveland, and I said, you know, to paraphrase the poet, we shall not see his like again ... Mr. Leader, we’re not going to look upon your like again. I’m not even going to ask God to bless you because he already had and I know where you are.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" you’re thinking, \"that was a long time ago, and Biden probably doesn’t even remember. That was way back in the summer of 2010, when people just didn’t know any better. They thought the Ku Klux Klan was some sort of harmless fraternal organization, like the Elks, or Rotary.\" Right.\\n\\nNo, they knew. Underneath it all, they never really disagreed with the core idea. Only the colors have changed. There exists in the darkest parts of human nature the instinct to form a mob and attack other people for how they were born. \"Fear of the other,\" is what sociologists call it. They say it’s a function of evolutionary biology.\\n\\nWhoever it comes from, however you describe the phenomenon, it’s real, and it’s a grave threat to America. This is an enormous, complex — and, yes, diverse — society. We have very little in common with each other, apart from the fact we’re all Americans. There are 350 million people living within the borders of our country. Most of us can’t leave, so we have to live together. If you want Americans to live peacefully without hurting each other, you have to treat them as individuals, not as members of warring tribes. You have to guarantee every American identical opportunities to work and live and go to school, as well as identical judgement under the law. Equality under the law.\\n\\nLARRY KUDLOW BLASTS BIDEN BLAMING BORDER CRISIS ON TRUMP: \\'NOBODY BUYS IT\\'\\n\\nYou can’t just announce that Americans of a certain color can’t have jobs. If you do that, things will tend to fall apart very quickly. We fought a war over this once, by the way, one that killed 700,000 people.\\n\\nNot that long ago, all Americans understood this. But then a new generation of Robert Byrds took control of the Democratic Party, and dark and primitive forces have been unleashed. You see them everywhere, so you hardly need to be reminded, but here’s one example: The Nation magazine, the flagship publication of the American left, just ran a piece with this title: \"I Am Not Ready to Reenter White Society.\"\\n\\nIt was written by a Harvard Law graduate named Elie Mystal. The open reads, \"I’ve said, here and elsewhere, that one of the principal benefits of the pandemic is how I’ve been able to exclude racism and [W]hiteness generally from my day-to-day life. Over the past year, I have, of course, still had to interact with [W]hite people on Zoom or watch them on television or worry about whether they would succeed in reelecting a [W]hite-supremacist president. But [W]hite people aren’t in my face all of the time. I can, more or less, only deal with [W]hiteness when I want to ... White people haven’t improved; I’ve just been able to limit my exposure to them.\"\\n\\nThat’s someone who went to Harvard Law School. That’s not normal, and it’s not healthy. It’s open race hate, and it’s the beginning of our actual destruction. As with Senators Hirono and Duckworth, no one in power says a word about it. So naturally, exhibitions like that accelerate and it becomes more dangerous.\\n\\nLast week, a corporate-owned website called The Root published a kind of terrorist manifesto written by a New York Times contributor named Damon Young.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe tract begins like this: \"Whiteness is a public health crisis. It shortens life expectancies, it pollutes air, it constricts equilibrium, it devastates forests, it melts ice caps, it sparks (and funds) wars, it flattens dialects, it infests consciousness, and it kills people.\"\\n\\nWith that established, Young wrote this: \"White supremacy is a virus that, like other viruses, will not die until there are no bodies left for it to infect. Which means the only way to stop it is to locate it, isolate it, extract it, and kill it.\"\\n\\n\"And kill it.\" You have to ask yourself, where is this going? Let’s pull back now before we find out.\\n\\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson\\'s opening commentary on the March 24, 2021 edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"',\n",

       "  'article_body': 'MSNBC far-left host Joy Reid once again spread misinformation on her Twitter account Monday, sharing a 2019 picture of a crowded Miami Beach in an attempt to shame vacationers for flouting coronavirus distancing guidelines.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t the first time, however, that Reid has spread conspiracy theories or other misinformation to her viewers and millions of Twitter followers.\\n\\nHere are 10 other times the MSNBC star has been caught disseminating fake news.\\n\\nMSNBC RATINGS SUFFER, JOY REID\\'S SHOW HAS WORST WEEKLY VIEWERSHIP EVER\\n\\nMarch 4, 2021\\n\\nReid referred to Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., as a conspiracy senator \"by way of Moscow,\" strangely insinuating that he was a Kremlin plant.\\n\\nThe remark drew derision from liberal journalist and corporate media critic Glenn Greenwald, who said it was \"bats--t crazy and as much conspiratorial derangement as anything from QAnon.\" This followed Reid saying in January that President Donald Trump was \"servile\" to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nReid is not the only MSNBC personality to draw connections between Johnson and Russia. MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace, one of the network\\'s most enthusiastic proponents of Russia election conspiracy theories, asked if Johnson and Russia were \"in cahoots\" last year because both were trying to damage Joe Biden.\\n\\nNov. 9, 2020\\n\\nIn a single, error-laden tweet, Reid informed followers that the data website FiveThirtyEight was named for George W. Bush\\'s 2000 election margin of victory over Al Gore in Florida, and that the \"Republican SCOTUS reversed the 2000 election.\"\\n\\nThat was all incorrect.\\n\\nFiveThirtyEight is named after the 538 electoral votes up for grabs in a presidential election, while Bush\\'s official victory total over Gore in Florida was 537 votes out of more than six million cast, leading to a recount. The Supreme Court also did not reverse the 2000 election result; the Bush v. Gore decision reversed a lower court\\'s order to recount thousands of votes in the state.\\n\\nMSNBC PERSONALITIES SHARE 2019 PHOTO OF CROWDED MIAMI BEACH IN FAILED CORONAVIRUS SHAMING ATTEMPT\\n\\nLater analyses showed Bush would have won the state even if the recount had gone forward.\\n\\nReid lived in Florida at the time of the 2000 election.\\n\\nAug. 5, 2020\\n\\nReid asked what Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., was doing in Russia in 2018 and \"whether he divulged any secrets to any Russian official.\"\\n\\nAs the Washington Examiner noted at the time, Reid could have merely done a Google search and found out Kennedy had traveled there as part of a congressional delegation that warned Russia against further election interference.\\n\\nAug. 10, 2019\\n\\nReid suggested then-Attorney General William Barr bore responsibility for the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, whose 2019 suicide while in federal custody has been the subject of rampant speculation in the media and popular culture.\\n\\n\"This Department of Justice does not exactly inspire confidence. Let\\'s just be blunt. William Barr\\'s Justice Department is not one you can readily simply rely upon and feel confident in,\" Reid said on her show. \"What do we make of all of this now that in this federal facility this person was allowed to be alone long enough to either harm himself or be killed by some—we don\\'t know what happened. We just don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nJan. 24, 2019\\n\\nReid was hardly alone in pushing one of the most infamous fictional media narratives of the Trump era: that a group of Covington Catholic students harassed a Native American man in Washington, D.C., when nothing of the sort occurred.\\n\\nMSNBC’S JOY REID MOCKS GOP AS \\'GRAND Q PARTY,\\' QUESTIONS IF SITUATION AT SOUTHERN BORDER IS REALLY A \\'CRISIS\\'\\n\\nStill, she did, interviewing Nathan Phillips on her weekend show \"AM Joy\" over a chyron that read, \"Viral video shows high school students wearing \\'MAGA\\' hats and mocking Native Americans.\"\\n\\nAfter an initial viral video purported to show the students surrounding and harassing Phillips, a subsequent investigation showed the students were the ones actually harassed by a group of radical Black Hebrew Israelites, and Phillips approached the students, not the other way around.\\n\\nJuly 1, 2018\\n\\nReid falsely accused a Trump supporter of shouting racial slurs at a 14-year-old during a City Council meeting in Simi Valley, insinuating she had called him a \"dirty Mexican.\"\\n\\nIn another post, Reid added, \"Make the picture black and white and it could be the 1950s and the desegregation of a school. Hate is real, y’all. It hasn’t even really gone away.\"\\n\\nHowever, the boy said his interaction about immigration with the woman was civil and she had made no such comments, leading Reid to delete her posts and apologize.\\n\\nThe woman, Roslyn La Liberte, sued Reid for defamation in 2019. The lawsuit was dismissed by the Eastern District of New York until being revived last year by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which argued that the July 1 post makes Reid \"liable for what is insinuated, as well as for what is stated explicitly.\"\\n\\nGLENN GREENWALD RIPS MSNBC\\'S JOY REID OVER \\'BATS--T CRAZY\\' CLAIM ABOUT SEN. RON JOHNSON\\n\\n\"I wasn’t really doing anything to him and everyone thought I was and that makes me really sad. It makes me really sad that I’m so vilified,\" La Liberte said.\\n\\nApril 23, 2018\\n\\nIn one of the most embarrassing media scandals in recent memory, Reid claimed hackers had gained access to her defunct Florida blog, The Reid Report, and planted unearthed offensive posts, such as cringing at gay men kissing and other homophobic items.\\n\\n\"In December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology,\" she wrote in a statement.\\n\\n\"I began working with a cybersecurity expert who first identified the unauthorized activity, and we notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach. The manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago.\"\\n\\nMaking the far-fetched claim even more strange was Reid had, just months earlier, already admitted to and apologized for writing similar posts on the blog.\\n\\nAfter a brief investigation by her cybersecurity expert, Reid admitted to viewers there was nothing to substantiate her hacking claims, although she still said she did not believe she had written the offensive items.\\n\\nTIM SCOTT FIRES BACK AT LIBERAL MEDIA CRITICS OVER \\'WOKE SUPREMACY\\' REMARK: LEFT HAS INTOLERANCE FOR DISSENT\\n\\nLater reporting revealed Reid had dabbled in 9/11 conspiracy theories, made anti-Semitic and anti-Israel comments, and even photoshopped then-Sen. John McCain\\'s head on the Virginia Tech shooter on her old blog.\\n\\nFox News contributor Joe Concha said the blog fiasco should have been the end of her career, but instead she was promoted to primetime. MSNBC is the same network that provided refuge to former \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Brian Williams, who was suspended for six months in 2015 after admitting he made up his oft-told story that he was in a helicopter that was shot down in Iraq.\\n\\n\"So now she knows she can literally say whatever she wants regardless of if there\\'s any truth to it, because MSNBC management basically told her without saying it, that\\'s she untouchable,\" Concha said.\\n\\nJan. 17, 2018\\n\\nReid had to apologize to conservative writer David French when she bizarrely accused him of making incendiary remarks in an article about minorities.\\n\\nReid responded to an article by French about a hypothetical nuclear attack, on the heels of the false alarm that occurred in Hawaii that month. French noted that a \"strike would devastate central Honolulu but leave many suburbs intact.\"\\n\\nReid didn\\'t appear to read French’s story in National Review, instead opting for watered-down, misleading pickups that were published by Newsweek and Raw Story that focused on Trump supporters living in rural areas. Despite French making no reference to either, Reid asserted he didn\\'t care if a nuclear bomb killed \"Democrats and minorities.\"\\n\\n\"We have truly entered the age of insanity when the conservative argument in favor of risking nuclear war is, ‘don\\'t worry, it will only kill Democrats and minorities.’ Shame on you @DavidAFrench,’\" Reid wrote.\\n\\nAfter a bipartisan outcry, Reid deleted the tweet, but the debacle was indicative of Reid\\'s knee-jerk style.\\n\\nMSNBC\\'S JOY REID SAYS TIM SCOTT ONLY PRESENT AT GOP PRESS CONFERENCE FOR \\'DIVERSITY\\'\\n\\n\"MSNBC should know that one of its hosts is making things up. It’s a smear, pure and simple. There is no excuse,\" French wrote at the time.\\n\\nAugust 20, 2017\\n\\nAccording to the Daily Caller, Reid spread an unsubstantiated rumor that the Trump campaign was hiring Black actors for an upcoming rally.\\n\\nHer proof was a left-wing account\\'s eventually deleted Craigslist advertisement soliciting actors.\\n\\nJune 20, 2017\\n\\nReid falsely claimed Donald Trump had won Georgia\\'s Sixth Congressional District by more than 20 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016, to assuage disappointed followers after Democrat Jon Ossoff narrowly lost a special House election there.\\n\\nIn reality, Trump won the metro Atlanta district by less than two points over Clinton. The Sixth District later swung to the Democratic column in 2018 with the election of Rep. Lucy McBath.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIn addition to peddling misinformation, Reid has also made headlines for her racially charged screeds, which include calling Black Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas \"Uncle Clarence,\" tokenizing Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and claiming all conservatives would trade tax cuts in order to openly use the \"n word.\"\\n\\nDespite her controversies, her star has only risen at MSNBC in the past five years. After Chris Matthews was forced off the air in 2020, she was picked to take his coveted primetime spot with \"The Reid-out.\" She, along with fellow liberal hosts Rachel Maddow and Nicolle Wallace, led the network\\'s unabashedly pro-Democratic special political coverage throughout 2020.\\n\\nFox News\\' Brian Flood, Bradford Betz contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  'article_body': 'EXCLUSIVE: Former \"Howard Stern\" show staffer Shuli Egar is the latest comedian to speak out against the ever-present practice of engaging in cancel culture.\\n\\nAmong the many performers who make their living telling jokes in front of complete strangers -- and are denouncing the era of cancel culture -- is Egar. Egar is a stand-up comedian and music artist who spent 15 years working under the shock jock before leaving on his own volition in order to start his podcast \"The Shuli Show\" on Hurrdat Media.\\n\\nFor him, the age of cancel culture is one that he believes is a trend for the worst and Egar laments the idea that the level of success a person achieves can make them a potential target of internet takedown.\\n\\n\"I think the higher up the ladder you are, the more you have to fear,\" the Israeli-born Egar told Fox News.\\n\\nEX-‘HOWARD STERN’ SHOW STAFFER, SHULI EGAR, REVEALS WHAT IT WAS LIKE WORKING FOR THE RADIO PERSONALITY\\n\\n\"You can\\'t cancel me. I\\'m already canceled, what do you think about that?\" Egar quipped. \"I\\'ll cancel myself, \\'Now what?\\'\"\\n\\nHence, Egar’s message for anyone he offends during his stand-up routines is simple: \"Don’t go to comedy clubs.\"\\n\\n\"At the end of the day, I think it\\'s all about the delivery system, the delivery mechanism, whatever it is you\\'re saying,\" he explained. \"First of all, if you\\'re offended at a comedy club, then don\\'t ever f--king go into a comedy club.\"\\n\\nEX-HOWARD STERN EMPLOYEES REVEAL WHAT RADIO PERSONALITY IS REALLY LIKE BEHIND THE SCENES\\n\\n\"These are jokes and that\\'s why you\\'re in a place called a comedy club. No one is standing up asking you to vote for him and saying this s—t,\" added the \"Stern\" show caller-turned-staffer. \"They\\'re sitting here telling you -- most of the time, stories from their own lives, thoughts that they have -- and it\\'s a safe zone for that. It always has been for years and years and years.\"\\n\\nMAHER BLASTS CANCEL CULTURE OVER TEEN VOGUE EDITOR\\'S OUSTING: WOKE \\'BRATS\\' CONTROL THE MEDIA NOW\\n\\nHowever, despite the uptick of prominent people being \"canceled\" in recent years, Egar said the trend is no different from what he has seen and experienced in his time playing gigs in Las Vegas, Nevada.\\n\\n\"It was like this in Vegas when I started -- this cancel culture has kind of always been around in Vegas because Vegas is pro-audience, they\\'re not pro-artists,\" he maintained. \"And by that, I mean as a comic – let\\'s say I\\'m working at a casino and I live there. That\\'s tough to get those regular casino gigs as a local because they fly in comics from all over the country that are headlining comics.\"\\n\\nHOWARD STERN WILL REMAIN AT SIRIUSXM FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THANKS TO NEW CONTRACT\\n\\nEgar claims Vegas gigs can be tough to play given the fact many casinos cater to their guests and frequent high-rollers.\\n\\n\"If you go up and you do a joke – and somebody who happens to spend a lot of money at the casino doesn’t like the joke – what\\'s likely to happen is it’s going to overpower you and your comedy and being funny and you\\'re done working that casino,\" he claimed.\\n\\nThe writer-producer further alleged: \"They\\'ll toss you out because this high-roller didn\\'t like what you said. So that is something I grew up with out there in the comedy world since the start. What we’re dealing with now in society is no different.\"\\n\\nEgar lightened the mood and explained through bouts of laughter that he simply tells jokes because he \"can\\'t afford therapy\" and writes them mainly so he can vent about his family.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\\n\\n\"I say some crazy s--t on stage, wild s--t about my kids, myself, my family, my wife, everything, and no one ever comes to me and says, \\'This bothered me,\\'\" said the funnyman. \"Because at the end of the day, it\\'s the delivery mechanism, I\\'m not up there angry about it. I\\'m not up there trying to teach you how you should think or live. I\\'m just throwing weird s--t out there that\\'s in my head.\"\\n\\n\"So this is my therapy. You\\'re going to hear some s--t.\"\\n\\nRegardless of which direction the cancel culture trend goes from here, Egar said he is neither fazed nor scared about anyone or group of people coming at him simply because he isn\\'t on any \"level\" that would warrant the effort it would take to cancel him.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"I\\'m not worried about it because I\\'m not on a level where there\\'s anything to knock me off of,\" he said. \"I walked away from everything to be my own man and I walked away the way I did so I could say whatever it is I want to say. So I\\'m going to take advantage of that.\"',\n",

And then I think maybe the fourth song is J. Cole’s “No Role Modelz.”\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nOK.\\n\\narchived recording (adrian williams) We got one more.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd I’m like —\\n\\narchived recording (adrian williams) Yeah, it’s burning.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n— there was an n-word.\\n\\narchived recording (adrian williams) Come on.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThere was another n-word.\\n\\narchived recording (adrian williams) This is only our first circuit.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI mean, it’s a J. Cole song. It’s n-words everywhere. So —\\n\\narchived recording (adrian williams) Get your feelings in order.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n— what happens when I, as a Black person, am in an environment where I don’t want to hear that word? It’s not a Black person using it on me, it’s a Black person saying it in a space where I’m pretty sure I’m one of the very few Black people in the room.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nMhm.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nWhat do I do with that? Who do I tell? I just have so many questions about the other people who are taking this class — are they hearing the word? I just feel like, suddenly, J. Cole and Adrian and I are performing for whoever else is in this class, and I can’t see them.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nMhm. I mean, not to be all armchair psycho about it, but you know, it sounds like, in a way, Adrian feels like he can assert his Blackness in this predominantly white space. We can’t ignore the fact that this is happening in the wake of everything that happened last year, and especially last summer.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nMhm.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nI think Black people in this country have been waiting for the opportunity to take up a lot more psychic space, and I think Black people in this country were like, I am tired of feeling like I can’t talk about the treatment that I endure. We’ve seen people dropping the veneer of whatever post-racial fantasy. No, I want to talk about my day-to-day lived experience, which excites me, actually.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nRight.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nBut you know, it sounds like Adrian is using whatever tools he has at hand to take up space.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYeah. Adrian didn’t say why he played this J. Cole song, why that song was on his playlist. But every time I hear the word, though, I’m just thinking, like, god, this word, this word. Why this word? I don’t want to be dealing with this right now. Why, why, why?\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nMhm.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYou know, again, I cannot see who else is in the class, but what I’m thinking as I’m hearing this J. Cole song is like, is anybody else bothered by this? And if they are bothered by it, is it a Black person who is bothered by it in the same way that I am?\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYou know, I am always in awe of its deployment by Black people, but then I get really annoyed, as well, because I never, ever, ever want to hear that word coming out of a white person’s mouth, no matter what. And I also think that, among most Black people, that is settled. Like, we don’t want to hear y’all say it because it just feels so devastating. And I’m of two minds about it. And I guess that sounds like a double standard, but it really isn’t if you sit with it and think about it.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nWell, I think this is the exact right moment to talk about this word. And we should talk about the spectrum of usages, not just in my exercise class or in music, but every place this word has resurfaced.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nAnd you know, look, this word is heavy. It brings up a lot, clearly, for both of us, and we assume for our listeners, as well. And so we don’t want you to be like Wesley caught out in Adrian’s class, so this is just a little bit of a heads-up that we will be employing the word in all its uses in this episode. And prepare the body, do some little squats, get some water, because we’re going to do this. Let’s see what happens. Wesley, I know you’re down. I’m down. So get the “Green Book,” get your mask, get in the car, let’s go.\\n\\n[theme music]\\n\\nI’m Jenna Wortham.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI’m Wesley Morris. We’re two culture writers at The New York Times.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nThis is Still Processing.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nJenna.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nOh, Wesley.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYou and I have for years been talking about the n-word. We’ve been talking about our relationship to it. We’ve been talking about whether we need it, how I feel about it, whether you use it. Part of the reason that I’ve been thinking about this word so much is that it’s been in our workplace recently.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nMhm.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd the reason it’s been in our work life is because a colleague used it.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nA ton has been written about this incident, and if you really want to know more, Google is your friend. You can just deep dive right on in. But just to give you a quick overview of what happened, a white colleague of ours was on a school trip with a bunch of high school kids and used the word in a sentence. You know —\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nRight. He used it quoting the word. He was not using it in the sort of conventional racist way. But he used it. And it essentially became this flashpoint in a conversation about whether or not it was OK to use the word. And you know, is there ever a good time to use it?\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nWell, and to get a little more specific, the debate spins out from there, ultimately results in our colleague leaving his job and leaving the New York Times.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd you know, I think that the thing that really upset me was that this word was going to threaten to tear our newsroom apart. You could feel it.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nFor sure.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd it’s really heartbreaking to see that this old-ass word is still boiling people’s blood, it is still costing people things, it’s still hurting people. I mean, I just can’t believe it. I can’t believe it.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nThat word, it’s not something that you expect to deal with in your workplace. You just feel so exposed and so vulnerable. And like, it just turns you inside out, because you’re kind of doing this mental inventory of dredging up all the times someone has said the word around you or to you, and then tried to tell you it wasn’t a big deal or to get over yourself. Because that’s what this word does, it lives beyond time. And it’s not something that anyone should have to deal with when they just want to show up and do their job. And it ate up so much of my energy. I mean, I kept being like, I’m fine, but then while this was happening, at the end of every workday, I was just completely depleted. I didn’t even have enough energy to take a bath. And I finally had to just admit and to reconcile, like, this is taking a huge toll. There’s this Toni Morrison quote that is just very grammable, and so I’ve seen it a bunch, but I’ll just paraphrase it. But it’s essentially that the function of racism is to be a distraction. And you get so caught up in explaining yourself and explaining your reason for being — and essentially defending your existence — that everything else falls away. And Ms. Morrison is cautioning us, do not fall into the trap. She’s right. I mean, it’s the only thing that you and I were able to talk about. Like, we were spending more time on the phone digging into this incident than we were talking about our book projects, talking about this show, talking about our love lives, talking about what we were cooking for dinner. Like, all we were obsessed with and consumed with was this word. And it was so unfair.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYeah. I think it’s America’s word. I think that white people have a stake in it as much as Black people do. And it’s been very interesting to watch white people defend their ability to use it. And it just really strikes me as being about a kind of sense of ownership in a way that they might not even intend.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nDeeply embedded in that ownership is the most incredible time capsule, or maybe it’s a ticking time bomb. And I think it’s scary because I’m like, do you know what lineage you’re invoking? Do you understand how that word has been wielded throughout time? And maybe you should revisit “Roots” and just reorient yourself in the power of this word and the way it really comes from a desire to limit and reduce and diminish and humiliate and really render a person into nothingness. And ask yourself, is that worth all this?\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nBut I mean, the fact of the matter is that you and I are talking about a thing that is, like, among Black people, settled, right? Like, I mean, it seems —\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n— settled, like, because it’s so baked into Black culture that it’s not going anywhere. When I lived in San Francisco, when I was 23 and 24 and 25 years old, I get on Muni, and you know, there’d be some Filipino kids or some Chicano kids just hanging out on the subway n-wording each other.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nMhm.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd I’m like — I would go up to them as a recent college graduate and be like, yo —\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nOh my god.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n— y’all need to stop. This is not your word. You can’t say that.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nProfessor Morris —\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI mean —\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\n— reporting for duty. I love it so much.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYeah. But I will report back to you that it didn’t go anywhere.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nThey were like, get out of my face.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYeah. And I think part of what I was thinking, or what I was trying to do, was preserve it. If I could just get it out of Chicano usage, then I could sort of get Black people to stop using it, too. But it was a folly. Again, I was 23, and I realized it just wasn’t useful. Like, there’s no point in doing this. In terms of where it’s going in the culture and who is using it, it’s settled. It’s settled. And to the degree to which, like, I was trying to win something, I was going to lose. I was just going to lose. I just had to come up with my own relationship to that word.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYes. It almost sounds like you’re trying to contain something that is uncontainable. You’re trying to put this tool back in its box, right?\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI was trying to put a lid on a boiling pot that had boiled all — been boiling over for centuries. Yes. Yes.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nWhy did that feel important to you?\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nWow, Jenna. Because it’s such an ugly word. It’s such a, like, horrible word to me, and I wasn’t — like, hearing it come out of mouths that weren’t even Black people, but they weren’t white people, either. And they weren’t using it maliciously, right? But it didn’t matter because to my ear, hearing it come out of any non-Black mouth, it upset me. It hurt me that they didn’t understand the degree to which that word is a toxic or radioactive element in any Black person’s social life. It was as common for them to call each other the n-word as it was for Black people to use it on each other.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYou know, when people are using that word in that really familial, familiar sense who are not Black, right, it’s of course the co-option of Black culture and the proximity to Blackness. You get so many points by inhabiting Blackness, but not actually being Black yourself, right? Just look at the entire Kardashian empire. And I’m really thinking about this pink Uno deck that came out this summer from one of the Jenners. Like, Uno, why? Why? It makes me angry to think about it. Like, you know why, right? Because they wanted to name that they know about Black things, including Uno. Let it go, OK? There are hundreds of card games that you could have chosen, and you chose that one for a very particular reason. As a related note, the artist Nina Chanel Abney put a a Uno deck — a very Black Uno deck — which is amazing. I bought 10 of them, just in defiance to the Jenner deck. But the point I’m trying to make is, the closer you can get to Blackness and Black people without actually being Black, it places you in this really interesting cultural hierarchy because people love that. They love it. They love to see Blackness on non-Black people. It feels really edgy. It feels really cool. It feels like you’re getting close to something without actually having to engage with the thing itself, also called anti-Blackness. But so I think there’s that. I guess, you know, I’m always in awe of the n-word. And as much as I don’t want to hear it, when it is employed in this cultural sense — whether it’s used as a greeting, whether it’s used in a song, pretty much any time it’s not being used by a white person, right — I really have to take a step back and, like, admire the power and the energy that it took to transform that word into something that can be used in that way. That word, which was erected to create a category of otherness, to create a category of non-humanness, to create a category of people who weren’t even seen as people, but to create us and then y’all. And we can do whatever we want to y’all because you’re not really people, you’re this other word. And to really, over time, that that word could mutate into this other usage, I mean, that is like — think about the power that that takes. Think about how much energy you have to invest. It took years of polishing that word, right, to get it to where it needed to be. To change it enough that it could be used in a way, in a multitude of ways, that are vastly different from the original creation of that word.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, I think that a little bit of what I’m trying to get at about the Muni situation was I think, in some ways, the fight for what it took to get to the place where Black people could even use it and have it be loving and affectionate and normalized, but at the same time, you know —\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n— I grew up in a family that didn’t use it. And I think my grandmother, who was born in 1928, was one of those — we’re basically Yankees. Nobody goes any further south than Maryland on my mother’s side of the family. And —\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nI love that.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n— most of us are in Philadelphia. My family was really concerned with, as were many people in my grandmother’s generation, with being upstanding and good even if you were poor and had nothing — which we were, and had lots of nothing. But there was this dichotomy that springs up, which is the difference between a Negro and an n-word.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nOh, lord. Yes, many conversations were had about that when I was a child.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYou know, my grandmother had a whole speech about n-words versus Black people. So much of their self-worth was in being defined against the n-word, and a lifetime — a childhood, childhoods, of being called that word by white people. And I mean, I don’t know if you remember this, but Chris Rock has a very, very, very famous routine about this. In his classic “Bring the Pain” routine, that I VHSed, by the way — I used to watch that over and over and over and over — he starts and says, I love Black people, but I hate n-words.\\n\\narchived recording (chris rock) Now, we’ve got a lot of things, a lot of racism going on in the world right now. Who is more racist, Black people or white people? Black people. You know why? Because we hate Black people, too. Everything white people don’t like about Black people, Black people really don’t like about Black people.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd the audience goes crazy because they know that he’s about to go there.\\n\\narchived recording (chris rock) There’s like a civil war going on with Black people. And there’s two sides. There’s Black people and there’s [n-words]. And [n-words] have got to go. Every time Black people want to have a good time, ignorant-ass [n-words] [EXPLCIT] it up.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nHe’s using the word, and he is letting it sit in his mouth like a really delicious sip of red wine that is still oxidizing. Like, he’s holding it in his mouth, just getting all the flavor out of it. Like, he’s chewing it like a piece of meat.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI mean, he’s also making it sound like the word that it is, right? He’s making it sound like it is a vile, ugly, disgusting word. The disgust with which he says that word, every time he says it, it is palpable, and it is vicious and vivid.\\n\\narchived recording (chris rock) Can’t go to a movie the first week it come out. Why? Because [n-words] are shooting at the screen. Hey, I love Black people, but I hate [n-words].\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYeah, that bit is really working on so many levels. And there’s of course just like the entry level, right, which is it’s been a lecture that’s been passed down to you from your parents, your grandparents. But it’s also acknowledging the vestigial hatred and trauma that comes with the need — I’m using air quotes — to make that distinction, right? And this kind of historical, repetitive task that Black people find themselves engaged in — that I still find myself engaged in — when you start doing kind of these mental gymnastics to physically, emotionally, psychically assert that you’re not a bad Black person. You’re not one of them, right? And it’s something that comes up for me when I go into like a high-end store. I try to look like I have money. You know, it’s something that comes up for me when I’m — I’ve actually stopped doing this, to be honest with you, but like making sure my hands are out of my pockets or making sure that my purse isn’t open. I mean, I don’t carry purses —\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nOh, I still — involuntary things I do when I go into public space so that nobody gets the wrong idea about me, same thing.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThere’s a degree to which being Black is a lot about optics, and a lot about having white people, having white society — the American caste system, basically — take you seriously to seem or look or sound worthy of being in that upper tier of the caste system, right? Part of my visceral reaction as being a 23-year-old who had finally felt like he had made it in San Francisco was the hope and prayer that I wouldn’t have to deal with that word. And the idea that I’m just on a subway on the West Coast — a place I had never been before but had these utopian feelings about — and here I am on the subway, as though I had never even left Philadelphia, having to contend with this word being used by not even Black people or white people? It just was too much for me. And I think that, to the degree to which my personality has been formed without even realizing it, Jenna, in opposition to being an n-word.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nAnd it’s tied to that bit because it comes from a place of having to fight for your worthiness, and it also comes from a direct historical experience of people who were called that word and their life hung in the balance, right? Like, someone is saying that word to you, you know that they’re also willing to probably kill you, right? And so that’s something your grandmother’s tapping into, that’s something my father is tapping into when they’re telling us don’t be an n-word. And it’s really scary and it’s really sad. And I think, you know, you and I are both reading the same book right now, which is by Randall Kennedy. It’s called — the first word —\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThe actual word.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\n— it’s called the actual word, colon, “The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.” And career is so interesting as a term because it is doing work. It is performing labor. And that labor is divisive. The labor is, as long as there’s someone below me, I’m OK. And again, that’s like a very insidious example of, like, white supremacist thinking that continues to need a lowest common denominator to rise above. And so for me, that’s the most interesting case to retire the word, even among Black people, because it does work. Like, it does a type of work that even when we can’t directly see it sweating, it is working, honey. Like, it is working in the same way that it worked since it came into existence.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nIt’s also much different to say it than it is to write it, I have to say. To put it in a set of quotation marks in a piece that you are writing no matter who you are is just different to me than saying it out loud. I have to make a reservation with my soul a week in advance before I say the word. It’s like, Wesley, don’t forget, on March 15, 2021, you are going to say the whole word. This is the gymnastics that I put myself through, where like even the idea of saying it just results in me, like, almost having a stroke. You know, I’ve been on this journey with this word, just really thinking about it in ways that I had never really seriously thought about it before, because I was so busy reacting against it. But I actually think that there is something — for as ugly as it is, I also think there’s something so beautiful about it. And I think that, when you feel its power and you feel — when you see a Black person wield it, there’s also just nothing, nothing like that. So let’s just take a break. And when we come back, we’re just going to talk about the beauty of the word. The impossible beauty of that word.\\n\\n[music]\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nI have to admit that I always feel a little silly saying, like, the n-word, as though that doesn’t mean something else.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYes.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nThe n-word, you know? Like, what does that even mean, you know?\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nJenna, you’re reading my mind. Yeah.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nIt’s so like, OK, we’re children. But listen, I grew up in a household where that word was not permitted to be used in any capacity. It was pretty well-ingrained in me, that’s not a word we use. And because I’m me, and pretty much everything someone tells me I can’t do, I find a way to do —\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nOh my god, this is where we’re the opposite.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nI’m a boundary pusher. I love finding the limits of something and then trying to get past that. So when I got to college, I went to U.V.A., as you know, which is a predominantly white school, but jokingly inside we called it a knockoff H.B.C.U. because there were just so many Black people there. And I met this crew of girls. We became super tight. We’re still close. And we loved to call each other the n-word. It felt really good to live in this space. It felt really good to be defiant. It felt really good to feel out something, at least for me, that had been taboo, and to play around with it and just employ it very liberally. And it felt like ours. It felt like something that belonged to us and only we could use, and we really leaned into it. And I felt really free. You know? It felt really fun. And it also felt like kinship. You know? It felt really special to have this term of endearment that always cracked us up. And I feel like we played around a lot with figuring out how to say it, because that one word with the A-A-H at the end of it has eons of inflections to it. It just contains entire galaxies of humor if you say it at the right time, in the right tone of voice, cutting it off at the exact right minute. I mean, in itself is such a tool of comedy. And it was fun to figure out how to perfect and play around with it.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nMhm.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nBut I’ve gone through over the last couple of years and really worked through really working on removing gender-specific references, gendered pronouns, skimming my vocabulary and my assumptions about ableism. You know, making space for different experiences and really trying to be mindful. So I’ve just arrived in a place, where I’m at today, it just doesn’t feel as good. And I think I’m just really tuning in to a sensitivity and a frequency of, you know, we’re tired. And a lot of us — and I’m speaking right now about Black people — a lot of us are just really fragile. At some point in the last nine years, after Trayvon Martin, I mean, I was experiencing this myself, but I just became really attuned to a fragility among some Black people. And understanding how the word, even when used by Black people in — I’ll just say a safe space, in community spaces — that it still dredged up that historical trauma, and that it still had this impact really shaped me. And it just naturally faded away. Like, it faded from my popular use. And it felt right. You know? That felt right. I don’t want to — I don’t know, I don’t want to hurt anybody. I don’t want to inflict more harm upon a Black person if I can help it.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nWell, I mean, you know, this is a word that has been — any living Black person, it’s been in your life probably the entire time you’ve been living.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nIt’s probably been in your life even before you knew what the word meant.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nOh, yeah.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nLike, I remember my niece coming home from school and being like, what’s jigger? Like, in preschool. It starts even before you have a sense of yourself as a racialized being. The world racializes you first. This is why we get so worked up about it, because it is just so much bigger than one instance, one mistake, one rap lyric. You know? It really enters your life even before you get a chance to figure out how you want to live your life. But the point I’m trying to make is, when I was younger, I felt like that word was the only thing that, without a doubt, belonged to me as a Black person that did not belong to a white person. And if you really think about it, that’s sad. But that’s not my inheritance. That’s not the thing that goes into the dowry, right? That’s not in my trunk of keepsakes that I’ll take with me when I move into my married house like in the old days. You know? It’s just not an antique for me. You know? It wasn’t mine to begin with. I’m in awe of it, but it’s not in my shoebox.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nMm. You know, I was thinking about how aware of it I was as a kid. You know, my dad was a big comedy records person. He listened to all his favorite comedians. And one of his favorite people to listen to, Richard Pryor.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nHm. Mhm.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd Richard Pryor is the greatest practitioner of the n-word in the history of its usage.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nHm.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nNobody has done more to simultaneously problematize that word, but also to normalize it as a way of being in the world.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYou know, it’s so funny because you sent me the album, and I didn’t listen to it.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI sent you a copy of “That N-word Is Crazy.”\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nMhm. So when I think of Richard Pryor, I think about my dad. I think about Joe Wortham because he loved that type of comedy. Even though we were not allowed to use the n-word, even though we were not — oh my god, we had so many rules, and I think this is very much from my dad’s trauma of growing up in the South, and then even being in Philadelphia, you know, I think he had a lot of trauma around us getting fingered as n-words with the hard ”-er.” So there were a lot of rules about what we could and couldn’t say, how we were supposed to speak, how we were supposed to wear our hair. When I was younger, it felt so controlling and restrictive — and it was. And I also, now that I’ve aged, I understand that he was trying to protect us from something that he had not been able to protect himself from. And he wasn’t able to protect us from it, either, to be honest, but that really weighs on my mind. So it was this confusing thing for me. So I would be a little kid. You know, picture me eight, nine, 10 years old on my belly, coloring in a book. And Richard Pryor is on the TV, you know, saying this word. And I’m just like (GASPING) in that little kid way, where you’re like, that’s a bad word. So for me, Richard Pryor just always had this association of taboo. And even as an adult, I still haven’t fully listened to that record. And you sent it to me. You sent me a copy, and I couldn’t do it. I don’t know why I couldn’t do it. I felt scared to open that chest.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nMhm. That’s fascinating. Yeah, I mean, he is doing the work of reclaiming the word, in a way. I mean, you know, at that point, it is long part of African-American vernacular, but there’s something about the way that he’s doing it where, like, none of the other Black comedians were using that word. Dick Gregory didn’t use it. Moms Mabley didn’t use it. Flip Wilson didn’t use it. Bill Cosby didn’t use it. It was Richard Pryor.\\n\\narchived recording (richard pryor) White folks do things a lot different than [n-words] do. They eat quiet and shit you build out of it. archived recording 1 Pass the potatoes. [LAUGHTER] archived recording 2 Thank you, darling. Could I have a bit of that sauce?\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd the thing that really moved me was the way that it just wants that word to be another word for person — for Black person — and to unload it of all its negative connotations. It’s so far away from Chris Rock’s usage. There aren’t Black people and n-words. There are just n-words. Every Black person is an n-word.\\n\\narchived recording (richard pryor) A lot of [n-words] ain’t scared, you know what I mean? Like when the Martians landed and shit, white folks got scared. Oh, my. Golly! I’ll tell ya! Just a big ol’ helicopter thing came down and landed. People got on [INAUDIBLE] all over their body! Big ol’ claw hands and shit! Jesus Christ! Nothing can scare a [n-word] after 400 years of this shit.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nIt’s still the most shocking word in the English language. It now just exists in two polar states. On the one hand, with Richard Pryor, there are white people. And on the other hand, there are n-words.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\n[LAUGHS] Well, there are polls, and then there are hand grenades, like the one Rihanna threw on February 1 in response to a tweet hosted by Daniel Cameron.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nDaniel Cameron, of course, being the attorney general of Kentucky, the man who presented the case to the grand jury as to whether or not to indict the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor’s death.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nAnd in case you didn’t feel the giant wave of grief and sadness in September that rocked many people’s worlds, none of them were indicted for her death. That decision unleashed such a wave of depression and disgust and anger and angst that, once again, another unarmed Black person dies at the hand of the police and no one is willing to do anything. So there’s just a lot around this man who was Black. So five months later, this man dust off his microphone and tweets, “Today marks the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth.” And then Twitter auto-populates with the little trifecta of the three Black raised fist. Then it continues. “This month, let’s take time to remember and celebrate the contributions Black men and women have made to our Commonwealth and our nation.” So he tweets that. And here comes Rihanna. She retreats him and adds the line, “Sup, n-word. #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor.” Microphone drop.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYeah, well, we should talk about what she’s making that word do.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nWell, it’s very interesting to notice that she employed the heated spayd games version with the “a” and not the historic plantation version with the “er.” That’s the first thing to notice.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThe other thing is that — this is a Black on Black operation here. It’s happening on Twitter in a very public place. But it also is like an interesting call in, because it’s simultaneously about this Black person not doing right by Black people — according to, in this instance, Rihanna and the many people who agree with her that justice was not served for Breonna Taylor. But it also — she’s using the word in the ugliest possible way that you can use it on a Black person, which is to say that you are an instrument of white power.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYou’re perpetuating harm against Black people. And you aren’t doing all that you can to live up to the best of what Black History Month purports to be about. And she is saying that whatever you just tweeted is hypocrisy. And all of those things are there in that one word.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nAnd she’s also letting him know, like — I mean, this is the part that’s hard to really grapple with, but he can always just be an n-word.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThat’s the other usage, right? That’s the other thing that this tweet is connected to for me. And so you have these two contexts for this word converging in these two words. And it’s just — I hope nobody ever sends me a tweet like that.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nI was just thinking that. But I also think that her ability to use it — it is such a linguistic power move. Especially an artist, right? Someone who’s thinking with so much deliberation about lyrics and words and presentation. Like, of course Rihanna understands, with just so much clarity and awareness, the chimeric quality of language and especially that word.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nWell, I mean, you saying that makes me want to ask you if we can go back to Adrian Williams for a second.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\n[LAUGHS] OK.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nWhy is what she did to Daniel Cameron OK to my visceral self? And I have a real problem being in that space with Adrian Williams and these white people that I can’t see with the J. Cole song. And the place that it takes me is this song by Solange, and I know very well, called “FUBU.” Writ large, the song is basically about Black culture belonging to Black people. And the opening lyrics of the song are all my n-words in the whole wide world.\\n\\n[music - solange, \"fubu\"]\\n\\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) All my [n-words] in the whole wide world.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nAnd it’s just so clear that she’s drawing a line around a kind of space, around a kind of cultural space.\\n\\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) Make this song to make it all y’all’s turn for us. This shit is for us.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nWell, as improbable as it sounds, I’m not sure that the deployment is all that different between Adrian and Solange, truth be told. You know, Solange makes this album in 2017. And the name of the album is “A Seat at the Table.” And she does an interview and she’s describing her word choice in that song. And she acknowledges, I don’t normally use the n-word in my songs. But at the time, I was on a road trip through Marfa, of all places. Marfa, Texas — really gorgeous artsy town in West Texas. Sky for days. A lot of creatives go there to make work. A lot of Black artists go there to make work. Solange is like, we’re visiting friends. We’ve been here a million times. And we have this really scary encounter with the police, right? They get hassled. And she’s also reading “Citizen: An American Lyric” by Claudia Rankine who’s a poet and devotes an entire text to her relationship to racism and racial aggressions and microaggressions and the depressed state it leaves her in. And Solange is just like, you know what? I’m not going to tiptoe around it. I’m going to say what I want. I’m going to lean into my artistic intuition, which is telling me to make a song, and to make this song. And there are just some things that are for us. And you know, in that song, she’s not just talking about the n-word. She’s talking about cornrows, she’s talking about affectations of speech. She’s just talking about so many things. You can put these things on all you want. You can layer on all these accouterments of blackness. But you will never be Black. Some things are for us.\\n\\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) All my [n-words] in the whole wide world.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nHearing her do that song live really does something in the body. It does something to you. It does create a space. And even if you’re in mixed company, even if there are non-Black people there, it still gives you that endorphin high that you always get in a musical setting when you’re in a live music setting. But you really feel loved and cared for and a sense of ownership. And it’s also like a caution, it’s like a yellow yield sign too where she’s also saying, back up, because if you are a white person in that space, and you’re watching people really just have a full body transformative experience, I think you understand something too, right? And it became this anthem of pride and ownership. And then when her next album comes out, “When I Get Home,” she releases a song called “Almeda” which has the same message, the same energy, and does not use the n-word.\\n\\n[music - solange, \"almeda\"]\\n\\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) We just sittin’ here fooling around. We just sittin’ here coolin’ around. We just sittin’ here high, comin’ down.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nAnd she’s just going through all these things she loves about being Black. And it has the exact same effect in some ways. It’s just a different approach into it. I mean, just like, what kind of white person is going to sing along to all the n-words in “FUBU“? I mean, it’s also really hard, I think, to be a white person or a non-Black person and sing along to the lyrics in “Almeda” which — brown skin, brown face, brown leather, brown sugar, brown — I mean, you know — black waves, black days, black baes, black things.\\n\\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) — brown zippers, brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves, black days, black baes, black days.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nThese are Black-owned things. That’s also precious. And that’s also something that is creating this protective sphere around everyone that’s listening to it and singing along to it. You know, I think it was really important for her as an artist to say, I’m fed up. And this is what that looks like. And then to kind of keep that thread going and do it in a totally different way because — I don’t know. It’s like, I think, Adrian, his own way — he was fed up. And he was tired of feeling like he had to tiptoe around something.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nYeah, yeah. I mean he — it’s interesting though, because it’s so subtle, right? You know, that reclamation of space, because it doesn’t make it any easier to hear that word in that space, because I guess I don’t know who I’m sharing that space with. And I think that does matter still to me. And he and I might even disagree about whether it’s even worth playing that song. But I definitely respect his right to do it. I feel like that for me is a journey that I’ve been on since I’ve been talking to you. [LAUGHTER]\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nWe’re definitely on it together. We’re on it together.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThere’s a story that you and I have with this word. And the reason — I want to tell you something about how it made me feel when you used it on me.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nAre you really going to talk about that?\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI do. I want to talk about it. Jenna, come on.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nAll right, fine.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nCome with me on this. Do you remember how you used it on me?\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\n[LAUGHS] Yes, because it was purely without thinking. We were working together. You had done something ridiculous. And it just slipped. I was like, listen, like what are — no, what are you doing? And you were like — your face dropped. And I immediately apologized. I was like, I’m so sorry. I realized we are different, of different ilks. I am so sorry. I did. I felt really bad. I still feel really bad.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nI remember absorbing it.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nYou did your Wesley thing when you’re uncomfortable, which is you just busted out into a very inexplicable long laugh that had no end for many seconds. You just kept laughing.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nWell, for the next three or four days after that, I was like, Jenna called me the n-word. Jenna called me the n-word. But it made me feel loved, I have to say.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\n[LAUGHS] This is crazy! This is bananas.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n— It’s really crazy. [LAUGHS] It’s true, though.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nThis word is bananas.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThe word is bananas. But I only received it as — I mean, I was shocked that you said it. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And I was like, I don’t know. When Black people, in the rare occasions when it happens to me, when a person feels like they can do it, [SIGHS] I do feel like it’s the Richard Pryor usage. It’s love. And I carry that around with me, too.\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nBut that’s — I am wondering why, that if you’ve experienced that were as a vector of love and affection, what stops you from using it in the same way?\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\n[SIGHS] [LAUGHS]\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nThere is that uncomfortable laughter again. I love it.\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThe truth, the honest to God truth — the first thing that comes to my mind as an answer is I’m just not that kind of Black person. I didn’t grow up using it. And I get a lot of pleasure from other people’s use of it so that I don’t have to use it. You know, I mean — I mean, for me, it would require becoming a kind of different person in my imagining of what it would be like to use that word. I mean, maybe there’ll be some point at which I’m comfortable partaking in that. But I don’t feel I have that in me. Does that make sense?\\n\\njenna wortham\\n\\nDefinitely.\\n\\n[theme music]\\n\\nwesley morris\\n\\nThat’s our show. And the good news is that we’re sticking around for a whole season.

The result was widespread frustration and, for many people, concern about an illness that might be going undetected.\\n\\nWith the federal government scrambling to meet the demand for testing and New York becoming the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, the state-run Wadsworth Center in Albany was for a time the only laboratory in the state that was approved to perform virus tests. Even then, the Wadsworth lab had the capacity to process only a few hundred samples.\\n\\nMany state residents could not get tested, and those with mild symptoms were often told to quarantine at home rather than attempt to be tested.

       "  'article_body': 'Live Covid-19 Live Updates: AstraZeneca Releases New Data Backing Its Vaccine The company said its shot was 76 percent effective at preventing Covid-19, a hair lower than the number it announced earlier this week.\\n\\nAfter a rebuke, AstraZeneca releases new data that shows its vaccine is still highly effective. Administering the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in London on Wednesday. Credit... Dan Kitwood/Getty Images AstraZeneca reiterated on Wednesday that its Covid-19 vaccine was very effective at preventing the disease, based on more recent data than was included when the company announced the interim results of its U.S. clinical trial on Monday. The company said in a news release that its vaccine was 76 percent effective at preventing Covid-19. That is slightly lower than the number that the company announced earlier this week. The new results strengthen the scientific case for the embattled vaccine. But they may not repair the damage to AstraZeneca’s credibility after U.S. health officials and independent monitors issued an extraordinary rebuke of the company for not counting some Covid-19 cases when it announced its initial findings this week. In a news release on Wednesday, the company said complete results from its 32,000-person study showed that its vaccine was 76 percent effective. On Monday, the company had said the vaccine appeared to be 79 percent effective, based on an interim look at 141 Covid-19 cases that had turned up among volunteers before Feb. 17. The latest finding was based on 190 trial participants who had gotten sick with Covid-19. AstraZeneca said on Wednesday that the vaccine was 100 percent effective in preventing severe disease and 85 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 in people over age 65. When it unveiled its interim results on Monday, AstraZeneca ignored dozens of recently confirmed Covid-19 cases that had cropped up in trial volunteers before mid-February. Listen to ‘The Daily’: The State of Vaccinations A look at the rapid expansion of shots, the people who are still holding out, and the rules of the road for those who are inoculated. In a letter to the company and federal officials, the independent monitoring board that was helping oversee the clinical trial issued an unusual reprimand of AstraZeneca for appearing to cherry-pick data to make its vaccine appear more effective. “Decisions like this are what erode public trust in the scientific process,” the letter said. The members of the monitoring board wrote that their statistical modeling had found that the vaccine might have a lower efficacy rate — between 69 and 74 percent — if the Covid-19 cases in question were included in the analysis. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases later disclosed the panel’s concerns via a public statement. It was not clear why the monitoring board’s projection turned out to be lower than the figure in AstraZeneca’s complete results. The latest results could still change because there are still 14 possible Covid-19 cases that AstraZeneca representatives have not yet classified as actual cases. Until they received the monitoring board’s letter, AstraZeneca executives weren’t aware that the panel expected them to include those cases in the results disclosed in their news release, according to a person familiar with the executives’ thinking. Vaccine experts said the brushback from federal officials appeared to reflect high levels of distrust between American regulators and AstraZeneca. Some worried that the episode could damage public confidence not only in AstraZeneca’s vaccine, but in all coronavirus vaccines. “There seems to be a breakdown in relations between the D.S.M.B. and the company, which is probably due to a variety of factors and is sad,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, referring to the independent monitoring board. “This vaccine is so important for global health and the disputes do not promote global health.” The dust-up over AstraZeneca’s U.S. trial results followed a safety scare in Europe that prompted more than a dozen countries to temporarily suspend use of the vaccine. Regulators in Europe said last week that a review had found the shot to be safe after a small number of people who had recently been inoculated developed blood clots and abnormal bleeding. The U.S. trial did not turn up any signs of such safety problems. Rebecca Robbins and\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nWhy is Europe having so much trouble vaccinating people? Shortages are just part of the problem. Registering for a vaccination in Milan this week. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times The European Union, where coronavirus vaccinations are moving at a maddeningly slow pace compared with those in United States and Britain, made clear this week that it is willing to flex its muscles to get more doses for its citizens, going so far as to curb exports of vaccine from the bloc. But the E.U.’s trouble inoculating its population does not result from an inadequate vaccine supply alone. Bureaucratic inertia, strategic errors, a diffusion of responsibility and logistical problems in booking appointments have all helped seriously undercut vaccination efforts. Consider the northern Italian town of Cremona, an early victim during the pandemic’s initial explosion in Europe. Over the weekend, the mayor got a call that the local vaccination center was empty. The region’s booking system had failed to contact and set up appointments with older residents — and more than 500 doses of vaccine were at risk of going to waste. “There was staff, there were also vaccines, but there were no people,” said the mayor, Gianluca Galimberti. Similar scenarios are playing out throughout the country, as the authorities struggle to get vaccines to older and vulnerable Italians who most need them. But the problems getting people vaccinated are hardly limited to Italy. The temporary suspension last week by multiple countries of the AstraZeneca vaccine, one that the European Union has bet on, was just one indication of how Europe’s rollouts have been plagued by an overabundance of caution, bad deals and flouted obligations by pharmaceutical companies. The situation remains so dire that the bloc unveiled emergency restrictions to curb exports of Covid-19 vaccines for six weeks. And the Italian government, acting on a request from the European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, sent the police to inspect 29 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in a facility outside Rome, amid suspicions of possible exports out of the bloc. Italy is paying an especially heavy price for the vaccination campaign problems. A full year after the country became the first Western nation to confront the virus, it now has the dubious distinction of having the highest rate of daily deaths from Covid-19 among Europe’s major powers. And the missteps have especially affected Italy’s most vulnerable population: the elderly. Fewer than one in five people over 80 have received both doses of a vaccine, and less than 5 percent of septuagenarians have received their first shot. When it comes to distributing vaccines, Italy is on par with France and Germany and a little behind Spain, but its difficulties in vaccinating older citizens are far more consequential, given that it is the country with the oldest population in Europe. “Every time the phone rings, I hope it’s them,” said Ester Bucco, a 84-year-old resident of the Lombardy region, who registered two months ago to get vaccinated.

Pool photo by Philip Fong FUKUSHIMA, Japan — When Bruna Noguchi signed up to be a torchbearer for the Tokyo Olympics a year and a half ago, she never dreamed it could be a controversial decision. But as the relay kicked off on Thursday morning in Fukushima Prefecture, the ceremony and those participating in it were at the center of a national debate, with many questioning whether the Games should go on in spite of the virus, the ballooning costs and other growing challenges. While more than three dozen people, including about 20 celebrities, have withdrawn from the relay, Ms. Noguchi, 22, has decided to participate. She is one of 10,000 people who will carry the torch over the next four months, from Fukushima to Okinawa in the far south to Hokkaido in the north and on to the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. “I can understand the feelings of the people who have decided to withdraw from the relay,” Ms. Noguchi said in a recent interview. “But I’m not worried.” The Japanese authorities had envisioned the start of the torch relay as a triumphant moment, and their choice of Fukushima as the launching point was heavily symbolic. Japan is calling these Games the “Recovery Olympics,” highlighting the country’s recovery from the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that ravaged Fukushima and other parts of northeastern Japan, as well as the world’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Seiko Hashimoto, president of the Tokyo organizing committee, said that it was “very meaningful” that the relay would start in Fukushima and that she wished for “the entire world to take a look at the reconstruction done in East Japan.” But the celebration on Thursday was subdued, and the relay was being carried out under a number of restrictions. Traditional Japanese drummers and a hula dance group opened the ceremony, performing before a group of around 150 attendees, who sat at socially distanced intervals and applauded politely. The ceremony and the first section of the relay were closed to the public. Routes will not be announced until 30 minutes before the start time, and spectators can attend the relay only in their home prefectures. No cheering or shouting is allowed, and fans must offer “support with applause or using distributed goods.” The relay will be live-streamed by NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster. Despite the precautions, some people in Fukushima said they were still worried. Shuhei Ohno, 34, a chef in Koriyama, said he feared that the torch relay might “raise the infection risk” nationwide. “The vaccine hasn’t spread widely enough in Japan yet, so how can there already be plans to host the Olympics?” he said. Still, the organizers are pressing ahead. Over the next 121 days, Ms. Noguchi and her fellow torchbearers will trot across Japan’s 47 prefectures, including islands off the coast of Tokyo, before completing the torch’s journey on July 23, the day of the opening ceremony.

Credit... Sebastian Hidalgo for The New York Times United Airlines plans to add more than two dozen new flights starting Memorial Day weekend, the latest sign that demand for leisure travel is picking up as the national vaccination rate moves higher. Most of the new flights will connect cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations, such as Charleston, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina; Portland, Maine; Savannah, Ga.; and Pensacola, Fla. United also said it planned to offer more flights to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America in May than it did during the same month in 2019. The airline has seen ticket sales rise in recent weeks, according to Ankit Gupta, United’s vice president of domestic network planning and scheduling. Customers are booking tickets further out, too, he said, suggesting growing confidence in travel. “Over the past 12 months, this is the first time we are really feeling more bullish,” Mr. Gupta said. Airports have been consistently busier in recent weeks than at any point since the coronavirus pandemic brought travel to a standstill a year ago. Well over one million people were screened at airport security checkpoints each day over the past two weeks, according to the Transportation Security Administration, although the number of screenings is down more than 40 percent compared with the same period in 2019. Most of the new United flights will be offered between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend aboard the airline’s regional jets, which have 50 seats. The airline said it would also add new flights between Houston and Kalispell, Mont.; Washington and Bozeman, Mont.; Chicago and Nantucket, Mass.; and Orange County, Calif., and Honolulu. All told, United said it planned to operate about 58 percent as many domestic flights this May as it did in May 2019 and 46 percent as many international flights. Most of the demand for international travel has been focused on warm beach destinations that have less-stringent travel restrictions. “That is one of the strongest demand regions in the world right now,” Mr. Gupta said. “A lot of the leisure traffic has sort of shifted to those places and it’s actually seen a boom in bookings.” Delta Air Lines issued a similar update last week, announcing more than 20 nonstop summer flights to mountain, beach and vacation destinations. Both airlines have said in recent weeks that they have made substantial progress toward reducing how much money they are losing every day.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nBoris Johnson hopes Britain’s vaccine success will vindicate his Brexit project. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s approval ratings have recovered, powered largely by the public’s enthusiasm about the vaccine rollout. Credit... Neil Hall/EPA, via Shutterstock Britain’s rapid rollout of coronavirus vaccines has revived the political fortunes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Now, Mr. Johnson’s allies hope the stark disparity between Britain’s performance and the European Union’s will do something perhaps even more challenging: vindicate their larger Brexit project. Pro-Brexit politicians and commentators are casting Britain’s vaccine deployment, which ranks among the fastest in the world, as an example of risk-taking and entrepreneurial pluck that comes from not being shackled to the collective decision-making of the 27 member states of the European Union. With vaccination rates that are a fraction of Britain’s, threats of export bans on vaccines produced on the continent and churlish statements about British-made vaccines by leaders like President Emmanuel Macron of France, the European Union has seemingly done all it can to make it look like Britain picked the right time to leave. “Boris Johnson is going to have a vaccine dividend, and that will give him a whole new narrative for the summer and beyond,” said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent. It’s a narrative that seeks to deflect attention from the costs of Brexit since Britain severed itself from the European Union in January — damaging disruptions to cross-channel trade and businesses choking on reams of red tape, among other headaches. And it conveniently ignores the harrowing experience many Britons had with the virus before the first vaccine “jabs” arrived last December. Until then, Mr. Johnson’s government was known mainly for its dilatory and erratic response to the pandemic — tardy lockdowns, frequent policy reversals, muddled public messaging and a hapless test-and-trace system — all of which contributed to Britain having the highest death toll in Europe. Now, though, the prime minister’s approval ratings have recovered, powered largely by the public’s enthusiasm about the vaccine rollout. In a new survey, 67 percent of respondents said they thought Britain had performed better on vaccinations than E.U. countries. A slight plurality — 40 percent — said they thought Brexit had helped improve Britain’s handling of the pandemic, while 14 percent said it had made it worse, and 38 percent thought it had made no difference. Mr. Johnson’s vaccine bounce, analysts point out, could be fleeting if a new variant emerges or if the economy does not recover swiftly. But Mr. Goodwin said one consequence of the vaccine success is that there are few signs of significant numbers of people rethinking the wisdom of Brexit or suffering the acute regret — or as he called it, “Bregret” — that some expected. Mark Landler and\\n\\nMississippi says it will remove ‘misleading’ advice about the vaccine. A drive-through vaccination site in Cleveland, Miss. Credit... Rory Doyle for The New York Times When Bobby Wayne, 64, called a Mississippi state hotline this week to find out where he could get the Covid-19 vaccine, he says, an operator gave him incorrect — and unnerving — information. “This is the way she put it to me: They had no documentation that the vaccine was effective,” Mr. Wayne recalled. “And then she asked me did I still want to take it.” When he replied yes, the operator told him that there were no appointments available and that he should call again the next morning, he said. The Mississippi State Department of Health chalked the misinformation up to confusion, saying it was the result of “miscommunication” over a misleading script given to the hotline operators. The script was referring to pregnant women, women who are lactating and people with compromised immune systems. It asked: “Do you still want to be vaccinated with an understanding there are currently no available data on the safety or effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines, including Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, in pregnant people, lactating people or immunocompromised people?” Most experts agree that the risks to pregnant women from Covid-19 are far greater than any theoretical harm from the vaccines. Doctors have also said they believe that the vaccines are safe for people with autoimmune conditions. Liz Sharlot, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said that the wording in the script could be confusing “when read out of context.” “We are replacing this confusing and misleading language,” she said in a statement. However, Ms. Sharlot said the operators had never been told that there was no documented proof that the Moderna vaccine or any other vaccine authorized for use by the Food and Drug Administration worked. “Just the opposite is true,” she said. “Both Moderna and Pfizer have high efficacy rates.” Mr. Wayne’s daughter, Elizabeth Wayne, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, complained on Twitter about her father’s conversation with the hotline operator, equating it with “violence.” “It’s dangerous,” Dr. Wayne said in an interview. “There is a therapy available. There is a way to treat something, and you’re making it difficult for them to have access to that treatment so it’s increasing the likelihood they may become sick.” The Mississippi Free Press reported the story after Dr. Wayne posted about her father’s experience on Twitter. Dr. Wayne said she was pleased that the health department appeared to take her concerns, and her father’s, seriously. “I think it was a really good example of the State Health Department trying to reach out because they actually want to restore faith” in the vaccine, she said. Mr. Wayne said he got his shot on Wednesday morning. “I feel a whole lot better,” he said.',\n",

The Atlantic provinces, however, continued to require anyone entering from the rest of Canada to quarantine for 14 days.\\n\\nAs with the first round of the pandemic, long term care homes have been hard hit in many provinces by the return of the virus. British Columbia also saw its once enviable record for controlling the virus evaporate.\\n\\nFor most of the year, the pandemic generally had not been a partisan issue nor did it feature that rancor that usually characterizes relations between provinces and the federal government. But in late October Mr. Trudeau’s Conservative opponents and several premiers who lead right of center governments began repeatedly charging that the government has no clear plans or timelines for vaccine distribution, an allegation Mr. Trudeau rejects.\\n\\nOn March 21, Canada closed its border with the United States, with exceptions for freight movements and some essential workers. It was the first time the entire border had been shut since Canada became a nation in 1867. In early December, Mr. Trudeau said that the virus will have to be brought under control worldwide before it reopens.\\n\\nMany parts of Canada saw the return of restrictions in November as politicians and officials urged residents to not gather during the holiday season.\\n\\nHow Cases Are Growing\\n\\nHere’s how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\\n\\nNew reported cases by day 0 10,000 20,000 cases Feb. 2020 Mar.

       "  'article_body': '“Talk about ‘shame,’” he added later.\\n\\nSome Republicans resorted to lies or distortions to condemn the measure, falsely claiming that Democrats were seeking to cheat by enfranchising undocumented immigrants or encouraging illegal voting. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said the bill aimed to register millions of unauthorized immigrants, though that would remain unlawful under the measure.\\n\\nThe clash laid bare just how sharply the two parties have diverged on the issue of voting rights, which attracted bipartisan support for years after the civil rights movement but more recently has become a bitter partisan battleground. At times, Republicans and Democrats appeared to be wrestling with irreconcilably different views of the problems plaguing the election system.\\n\\nSenator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the top Republican on the Senate Rules Committee, which convened the hearing, said states were taking appropriate steps to restore public confidence after 2020 by imposing laws that require voters to show identification before voting and limiting so-called ballot harvesting, where others collect voters’ completed absentee ballots and submit them to election officials. He said that if Democrats were allowed to rush through changes on the national level, “chaos will reign in the next election and voters will have less confidence than they currently do.”\\n\\nThe suggestion piqued Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the committee chairwoman, who shot back that it was the current elections system — an uneven patchwork of state laws and evolving voting rules — that had caused “chaos” at polling places.\\n\\n“Chaos is what we’ve seen in the last years — five-hour or six-hour lines in states like Arizona to vote. Chaos is purging names of longtime voters from a voter list so they can’t go vote in states like Georgia,” she said. “What this bill tries to do is to simply make it easier for people to vote and take the best practices that what we’ve seen across the country, and put it into law as we are allowed to do under the Constitution.”\\n\\nWith Republicans unified against them, Democrats’ best hope for enacting the legislation increasingly appears to be to try to leverage its voting protections — to justify triggering the Senate’s so-called nuclear option: the elimination of the filibuster rule requiring 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to advance most bills.',\n",

Under Colorado state law, such rifles are banned.\\n\\nBut the gun purchased by Mr. Alissa, while carrying some of the hallmarks of a longer AR-15, had instead been marketed as a pistol — a gun that can be shot with one hand but which comes with a stabilizer that looks similar to the buttstock of a rifle. As such, it would have been allowed under state law, but it appears to conflict with Boulder’s assault weapons ban, which prohibits pistols with magazines outside the grip and also devices that allow it to be stabilized with both hands.\\n\\nGuns purchased from licensed dealers must go through a federal background check, and states have embraced broader background-check rules to prevent sales to troubled people outside of gun stores. States, including Colorado in 2019, have also adopted red-flag laws that allow a judge to temporarily restrict a person’s access to firearms if they are found to be a danger to themselves or others.\\n\\nMr. Alissa had been convicted of a misdemeanor in the assault of another student in his high school a few years ago. And Mr. Alissa’s brother told CNN that his brother had shown signs of being paranoid and antisocial. But while federal and state laws can prevent people who are a danger to the community from acquiring or possessing guns, it does not appear that Mr. Alissa’s past actions ever triggered such restrictions against him.',\n",

There are no monetary penalties for such violations, though workers can be made whole through back pay.\\n\\nThe PRO Act would outlaw mandatory anti-union meetings, enact financial penalties for threatening or firing workers and help wrongly terminated workers win quick reinstatement.

       "  'article_body': 'Live United Airlines Adds Flights as Travel Demand Rises: Live Business Updates\\n\\nUnited Airlines will add more than two dozen flights as leisure travel picks up. Most of United’s new flights will connect cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations. Credit... Sebastian Hidalgo for The New York Times United Airlines plans to add more than two dozen new flights starting Memorial Day weekend, the latest sign that demand for leisure travel is picking up as the national vaccination rate moves higher. Most of the new flights will connect cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations, such as Charleston, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina; Portland, Maine; Savannah, Ga.; and Pensacola, Fla. United also said it planned to offer more flights to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America in May than it did during the same month in 2019. The airline has seen ticket sales rise in recent weeks, according to Ankit Gupta, United’s vice president of domestic network planning and scheduling. Customers are booking tickets further out, too, he said, suggesting growing confidence in travel. “Over the past 12 months, this is the first time we are really feeling more bullish,” Mr. Gupta said. Airports have been consistently busier in recent weeks than at any point since the coronavirus pandemic brought travel to a standstill a year ago. Well over one million people were screened at airport security checkpoints each day over the past two weeks, according to the Transportation Security Administration, although the number of screenings is down more than 40 percent compared with the same period in 2019. Most of the new United flights will be offered between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend aboard the airline’s regional jets, which have 50 seats. The airline said it would also add new flights between Houston and Kalispell, Mont.; Washington and Bozeman, Mont.; Chicago and Nantucket, Mass.; and Orange County, Calif., and Honolulu. All told, United said it planned to operate about 58 percent as many domestic flights this May as it did in May 2019 and 46 percent as many international flights. Most of the demand for international travel has been focused on warm beach destinations that have less-stringent travel restrictions. “That is one of the strongest demand regions in the world right now,” Mr. Gupta said. “A lot of the leisure traffic has sort of shifted to those places and it’s actually seen a boom in bookings.” Delta Air Lines issued a similar update last week, announcing more than 20 nonstop summer flights to mountain, beach and vacation destinations. Both airlines have said in recent weeks that they have made substantial progress toward reducing how much money they are losing every day.\\n\\nUnemployment claims will indicate the recovery’s traction. An outdoor seating area at a Bronx restaurant. The hospitality industry has been hit especially hard by job losses during the pandemic. Credit... Michael Young for The New York Times The labor market’s ability to improve as the economy recovers and the virus recedes will be tested Thursday morning when the government reports the latest data on unemployment claims. Although the pace of vaccinations, as well as passage of a $1.9 trillion relief package this month, has lifted economists’ expectations for growth, the labor market has lagged behind other measures of recovery. At 6.2 percent, the unemployment rate is still nearly three percentage points above where it was in February 2020, before the coronavirus arrived in force. Initial claims, counting regular unemployment insurance and emergency programs, have been at more than one million a week since the fall, partly because some workers have been laid off more than once. Still, the easing of restrictions on indoor dining areas, health clubs, movie theaters and other gathering places offers hope for the millions of workers who were let go in the last 12 months. And the $1,400 checks going to most Americans as part of the relief bill should help spending perk up in the weeks ahead. “We’re expecting to see sharp declines in jobless claims in the coming weeks as the service sector comes back online,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. “The labor market will benefit from a reopening, but it will take time for a complete recovery.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\n‘We’re not out of this yet,’ Esther George of the Fed says. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said she expected inflation to “firm,” given time. Credit... Ann Saphir/Reuters Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, says that although the outlook for growth has improved as vaccinations increase and the government rolls out relief packages, the path of the pandemic remains a major question hanging over the U.S. and global economies. “We’re not out of this yet,” Ms. George said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s hard to know what the dynamics will be on the other side.” Ms. George said she was focused on labor force participation as a sign of the job market’s strength more than the headline unemployment rate, which has fallen to 6.2 percent from a 14.8 percent peak but misses many people who aren’t looking for new jobs after losing theirs during the pandemic. Participation, the share of people working or looking, remains a hefty two percentage points below its prepandemic levels. “That might be the thing I really watch in the coming months,” she said. Ms. George expects inflation to “firm,” but that the process is likely to take a while, she said, and it is “too soon to say” whether it will end with a more meaningful rise. Some prominent economists have begun to warn that prices, which have been low for decades, could rise rapidly as the government spends big and the Fed keeps rates at rock bottom to support the economic recovery. “Wages are a very telling factor in a story about inflation,” Ms. George said. Many economists look for faster growth in compensation as a signal that inflation is sustainable, not just driven by short-lived supply constraints or temporary quirks in the data. Ms. George’s colleagues, including Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, have been clear that they expect prices to move higher this year but will not necessarily see that as an achievement of their inflation goal. The Fed redefined its target last year and now aims for 2 percent annual price gains, on average, over time. Ms. George did not venture a guess of when the Fed will hit its three criteria for raising interest rates: full employment, 2 percent realized price gains and the expectation of higher inflation for some time. Some Fed officials expect to raise rates next year or in 2023, but most of them expect the initial increase to come even later.

Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Companies harmed by the coronavirus pandemic can soon borrow up to $500,000 through the Small Business Administration’s emergency lending program, raising a cap that has frustrated many applicants. “The pandemic has lasted longer than expected,” Isabella Casillas Guzman, the agency’s administrator, said on Wednesday. “We are here to help our small businesses, and that is why I’m proud to more than triple the amount of funding they can access.” The change to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program — known as EIDL and pronounced as idle — will take effect the week of April 6. Those who have already received loans but might now qualify for more money will be contacted and offered the opportunity to apply for an increase, the agency said. The Small Business Administration has approved $200 billion in disaster loans to 3.8 million borrowers since the program began last year. Unlike the forgivable loans made through the larger and more prominent Paycheck Protection Program, the disaster loans must be paid back. But they carry a low interest rate and a long repayment term. Normally, the decades-old disaster program makes loans of up to $2 million, and in the early days of the pandemic, the agency gave some applicants as much as $900,000. But it soon capped loans at $150,000 because it feared exhausting the available funding. That limit — which the agency did not tell borrowers about for months — angered applicants who needed more capital to keep their struggling ventures alive. The agency has $270 billion left to lend through the pandemic relief program, James Rivera, the head of the agency’s Office of Disaster Assistance, told senators at a hearing on Wednesday.\\n\\nTired of Zoom calls? So is Citigroup’s chief executive. Jane Fraser in 2019. “The blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,” she told Citigroup employees. Credit... Erin Scott/Reuters Complaints of “Zoom fatigue” have emerged across industries and classrooms in the past year, as people confined to working from home faced schedules packed with virtual meetings and often followed up by long video catch-ups with friends, reports Anna Schaverien of The New York Times. But Citigroup, one of the world’s largest banks, is trying to start a new end-of-week tradition meant to combat that fatigue: Zoom-free Fridays. The bank’s new chief executive, Jane Fraser, announced the plan in a memo sent to employees on Monday. Recognizing that workers have spent inordinate amounts of the past 12 months staring at video calls, Citi is encouraging its employees to take a step back from Zoom and other videoconferencing platforms for one day a week, she said. “The blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,” Ms. Fraser wrote in the memo, which was seen by The New York Times. No one at the company would have to turn their video on for any internal meetings on Fridays, she said. External meetings would not be affected. The bank outlined other steps to restore some semblance of work-life balance. It recommended employees stop scheduling calls outside of traditional working hours and pledged that when employees can return to offices, a majority of its workers would be given the option to work from home up to two days a week.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story',\n",
