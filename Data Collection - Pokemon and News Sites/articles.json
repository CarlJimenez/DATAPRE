I do feel that they\u2019re following the science and I do think that this is hard work. There is no playbook for this in any leadership course,\u201d Cardona said.Cardona wouldn\u2019t put a timeline on when all of the nation\u2019s more than 14,000 public school districts should reopen for full, five-day a week, in-person school, but says he hopes it\u2019s as soon as possible.\u201cI\u2019d like to think that in many places we can do that this spring,\u201d Cardona told Tapper. \u201cI know schools that are functioning all day, every day, five days a week for all students currently. And we need to continue to grow and make sure that we\u2019re giving students an opportunity to be in school as much as possible. There is no substitute for in-person learning.\u201dCardona also said he\u2019s encouraged by the American Rescue Plan being signed by President Biden on Thursday, which will provide $125 billion to K-12 public schools. The funding will\u00a0help districts implement mitigation strategies including social distancing, and for personal protective equipment\u00a0and upgrades to school buildings.Cardona said some districts lacking the proper resources have likely been a factor in slow reopening, or why they still don\u2019t offer a hybrid or in-person option.When pressed on whether the role of teachers unions have, on the whole, helped or hurt with the speed of school reopening, Cardona said teachers have \u201cbent over backwards\u201d trying to learn how to teach in a completely new way, essentially overnight.\u201cThey need to make sure that they\u2019re advocating for a safe work environment as well,\u201d Cardona said. \u201cI definitely feel that having educators, school principals, superintendents, board members at the table is a critical component of safely reopening and reopening quickly.\u201d", "author": "From CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Stuart"}, {"date": " March 12, 2021", "title": "Head of largest teachers' union says educators  \"want to be back in-person with\u00a0their students\"", "full article": "CNNBecky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the country, joined CNN tonight to discuss what teachers, staff and schools around the US are doing to return to in-person learning as the grip of the coronavirus pandemic begins to loosen. \"All of them want nothing more\u00a0than to be in-person with\u00a0their students.\u00a0That is how they were trained\u00a0to teach and work with them,\u00a0and they miss them,\" Pringle told CNN during a back-to-school special tonight. \"They want to be back in person.\u00a0What we've been saying for, and\u00a0now, a year, is we have been\u00a0asking for the resources we\u00a0need to do just that.\"Pringle also spoke to the countless number of teachers around the US who fear a return to in-person instruction while the pandemic persists.\"Each school district is\u00a0making the decisions based on\u00a0the guidance of the CDC, and\u00a0they are being so creative to\u00a0keep students safe, and make\u00a0sure they implement, with\u00a0fidelity, the guidelines the\u00a0CDC has laid out,\" she said. \"They are doing a variety of\u00a0things, hybrid measures,\u00a0methods of arrival, and\u00a0messages to keep educator safe.\""}, {"date": " March 12, 2021", "title": "US students share the struggles they've faced through virtual learning during the pandemic", "full article": "CNN asked teachers,\u00a0students and parents to submit video\u00a0diaries about the challenges they've faced while learning virtually during the coronavirus pandemic.One of those videos aired tonight during CNN's back-to-school special hosted by Jake Tapper featured Reese McCall-Reguerra of Los Angeles, California, who said it's been hard to make friends as a new student.\"I am a new student to the\u00a0school, a 9th grader, and it is\u00a0very hard to socialize, and\u00a0make friends,\" he said.Here are three stories from students across the US:"}, {"date": " March 12, 2021", "title": "Education Secretary Miguel Cardona says his top priority is \"safely opening our schools\"", "full article": "CNNMiguel Cardona's top priority as President Biden's secretary of education is to open schools safely and quickly to provide relief to millions of families struggling under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic.\"Without question, my biggest\u00a0priority, right now, is safely opening our schools and do it\u00a0quickly,\" Cardona said tonight on CNN. \"It is a balance to ensure\u00a0we're moving the needle in the right\u00a0direction to get students in\u00a0school every day.\u00a0We have to do so making sure we\u00a0are adhering to these mitigation strategies that have\u00a0worked to keep our schools safe.\"More on Cardona: Cardona, whose family is from Puerto Rico, enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top of Connecticut's public education system. He began his career as fourth-grade teacher in Meriden, in the same district where he attended school. Cardona soon became a principal and then assistant superintendent of the district before being named state commissioner in 2019.His predecessor, Betsy DeVos, was a controversial nominee from the start when former Vice President Mike Pence had to make a tie-breaking vote to confirm her to the role. DeVos, a staunch school choice and private school advocate, had almost no experience in public education and was often at odds with the teachers' unions."}, {"date": " March 12, 2021", "title": "Los Angeles County to reopen indoor dining, movie theaters Monday", "full article": "Outside view of the closed AMC Theater, amid the coronavirus pandemic, May 12, 2020, in Burbank, California.

County that plan on reopening for indoor dining Monday must follow certain protocols to maintain proper safety and social distancing rules, the department said. There must be eight feet of distancing between indoor dining tables, air conditioning systems must be evaluated and are in good working order, and ventilation must be increased to the greatest extent possible. The maximum number of guests at each table at indoor and outdoor tables will be six people.On Monday, L.A.
